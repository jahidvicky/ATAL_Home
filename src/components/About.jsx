                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Our CEO: A Visionary Leader with a Clear Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in a small village, our CEO's journey is a testament to
                    self-motivation, discipline, and resilience. Beginning his career with
                    the prestigious <strong>Oswal Group</strong>, he quickly earned a
                    reputation as a self-made, respected pillar of society. His relentless
                    drive propelled him through the ranks of major corporations such as{" "}
                    <strong>Hindustan Lever</strong> and <strong>DuPont Chemicals</strong>,
                    and later in Canada with <strong>SNC Lavalin, Magna Group, Honeywell</strong>,
                    and key players in the aviation and petrochemical industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2007, inspired by his own vision and the leadership he admired
                    within Canada's optical industry, he aspired to start his own optical
                    business. However, due to demanding career commitments, this dream was
                    temporarily set aside. Despite the delay, his vision never wavered. He
                    remained deeply inspired by the optical leaders in Canada, keeping the
                    dream alive.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Bringing a Dream to Life</h2>
                <p>
                    After years of building a successful career and settling his
                    family—whose members have since flourished in Canadian society through
                    their own community contributions—our CEO finally turned his long-held
                    vision into reality. In 2023, <strong>Atal Optical</strong> was
                    officially incorporated, marking a powerful new chapter dedicated to
                    serving the community with integrity, expertise, and compassion.
